I want to build an interface in python that downloads an refreshes the csv list from https://www.vpngate.net/api/iphone/  and allows the user to filter the list per country and order by the different fields and the user can pick  one row wich would decode the OpenVPN_ConfigData_Base64 column into a file and execute the openconnect command with that file as config


pip install pandas requests tabulate
pip install pystray pillow
